Kyler ChasePageRank NotesDeveloped at Stanford by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1996Link based, Assumes surfer going through web randomlyCan be applied to entire web or to a subset of documentsBasic Idea:Ignores multiple links from one page to another page as well as links from a page to itselfInitial PR for all pages is 1/NIf B, C, and D all link to A, the PR(A) = PR(B) + PR(C) + PR(D)PR(A) = PR(B)/L(B) + PR(C)/L(C) + PR(D)/L(D)Sigma notationIterates multiple times because of the changing PRs of other pagesDamping FactorProbability that surfer will eventually stop clickingUsually accepted as 0.85 based on various studiesNew PR(A) = (1-d)/N + d(PR(A))Lowers PR valueThe (1-d)/N is for the idea that the surfer will switch to random page when boredIntentional Surfer ModelBasic Algorithm based on random surfer modelIntentional surfer model keeps track of page browsing traffic for popularityActual rank in search engine is a combination of both of those things
